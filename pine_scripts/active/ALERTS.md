# Alert Inventory — Active Pine Indicators

**Snapshot as of 2026-05-13.** Source of truth for what fires from where, what reaches Telegram, what gets dropped, and why.

This file describes the **4 active Pine indicators** in `pine_scripts/active/` and the **backend gating layers** that filter their output before delivery.

---

## At a glance — what reaches Telegram

| Direction | Symbols | Caps / cooldowns |
|---|---|---|
| **BUY** | Every watchlist symbol | ETH MA bounces: 4h rolling cooldown per `(symbol, alert_type)`. Others: none. |
| **SHORT** | **SPY / QQQ / AIQ / NDX only** (other symbol shorts dropped at the backend) | None |
| **NOTICE** | **SPY / QQQ / AIQ / NDX only** (other symbol notices dropped at the backend) | 60-min dedup per `(symbol, direction, alert_type)` |

## Pine 1 — `ma-ema-daily`

**File**: `pine_scripts/active/ma_ema_daily.pine`
**Monitors**: 9 daily moving averages — EMA 5 / 10 / 21 / 50 / 100 / 200, SMA 50 / 100 / 200
**Alert taxonomy**: 4 event types × 9 MAs. The MA name is appended to the rule key (e.g. `tv_ma_bounce_long_v3_ema5`).

### Event types

| Rule prefix | Direction | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `ma_bounce_long_v3_<ma>` | BUY | Bar wicks the MA from above + closes back above on a green bar (strict_long) **OR** prev close was below MA, this bar's close is above (reclaim_long, e.g. gap-up recovery) |
| `ma_rejection_short_v3_<ma>` | SHORT | Symmetric short — wick into MA from below + closes back under, red bar |
| `ma_proximity_long_v3_<ma>` | NOTICE | Bar held NEAR an MA (within %) without touching, green close |
| `ma_proximity_short_v3_<ma>` | NOTICE | Symmetric short proximity |

### Examples
- `tv_ma_bounce_long_v3_ema5` — EMA 5 bounce (LONG) — fast short-term momentum
- `tv_ma_bounce_long_v3_ema5_ema10` — Stacked EMA 5 + EMA 10 bounce
- `tv_ma_rejection_short_v3_ema21` — EMA 21 rejection (SHORT)
- `tv_ma_proximity_long_v3_ema100` — EMA 100 proximity (NOTICE)

### Total events
- 9 bounce-long (BUY) + 9 rejection-short (SHORT) + 9 proximity-long (NOTICE) + 9 proximity-short (NOTICE) = **36 distinct alert keys**
- Plus stacked-MA variants (`ema5_ema10`, `ema5_ema21` etc.)

## Pine 2 — `levels-day-vwap`

**File**: `pine_scripts/active/levels_day_vwap.pine`
**Monitors**: PDH / PDL + PWH / PWL (internal) + PMH / PML (internal) + VWAP + today's opening price
**Alert taxonomy**: 5 staged level events + 3 VWAP events + 2 open-line events = **10 distinct alert keys**

### Staged level events (D / W / M unified)

Each event fires when price crosses ANY of the corresponding D/W/M levels. Direction varies by TF that triggered:

| Rule | Triggered by | Direction (D) | Direction (W/M) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `staged_pdh_break` | Close above PDH / PWH / PMH | **BUY** | NOTICE |
| `staged_pdl_reclaim` | Close back above PDL / PWL / PML | **BUY** | NOTICE |
| `staged_pdh_rejection` | Wick into PDH / PWH / PMH + close back under | **SHORT** | NOTICE |
| `staged_pdh_failed_short` | Closed above PDH / PWH / PMH then back below within sweep window | **SHORT** | NOTICE |
| `staged_pdl_break` | Close below PDL / PWL / PML | **SHORT** | NOTICE |

**Sweep window** (for `staged_pdh_failed_short` and `staged_pdl_reclaim`'s sweep variant):
- **SPY / QQQ**: 200 bars (covers a full RTH session)
- All other symbols: 5 bars (default `sweep_window_bars` input)

### VWAP NOTICEs

Pine-gated to SPY / QQQ / AIQ only. Require `fire_vwap_alerts=true` (default false; flip on the SPY 10m chart instance).

| Rule | Direction | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `vwap_reclaim_long` | NOTICE | Close back above VWAP after N consecutive bars below |
| `vwap_reject_short` | NOTICE | Close back below VWAP after N consecutive bars above |
| `vwap_support_hold` | NOTICE | Bar wicked down to VWAP (within 0.1%) + closed back above on green bar |

### Open-line events (fired from levels-day-vwap, visual layer in Pine 4)

The open-line ALERTS fire from this indicator (so we only burn one TV
watchlist alert slot for both PDH/PDL/VWAP and open events). The visual
plot + LOST/RECL diamond markers live in the separate `open-line` indicator
(Pine 4) so the visual layer can be toggled on/off independently.

| Rule | Direction | Symbols | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open_reclaimed` | **BUY** | **All symbols** | First close back above today's open after having lost it. One-shot per session. The NVDA-style trend-day signal. |
| `open_support_hold` | **BUY** | **All symbols** | Defended open from above WITHOUT closing below. Wicked down to within 0.2% of today_open, closed back above on a green bar. AVGO / ORCL-style "from high to open and hold" pattern. One-shot per session, mutually exclusive with reclaim (blocked once `ol_lost_today=true`). |
| `open_lost` | NOTICE | SPY / QQQ / AIQ / NDX only | First close below today's open after holding above earlier. One-shot per session. Bearish session shift on the indexes. |

State machine: `ol_was_above_open` flag must be set (price made a bar with `close > today_open` earlier in session) before any open alert is eligible. `ol_lost_today` must be set before `open_reclaimed` fires. `open_support_hold` only fires while `ol_lost_today` is false — the two are deliberately mutually exclusive (hold = pristine defense, reclaim = recovery after loss). All three reset at the next session open.

### Inside-day flag

Every alert payload from this indicator carries an `inside_day` boolean. True when `today_open` sits between yesterday's PDH and PDL (no overnight gap). Inside days tend to range, so the triage agent uses this to degrade conviction on directional setups (PDH break, MA bounce, open_reclaimed/hold) — the alert still fires, just with lower confidence in the Telegram message.

### Chart day-type badge (replaces stage badge)

The top-right table cell on the chart now shows a session-type classification instead of Stage 1/2/3/4. Seven mutually exclusive buckets based on today_open vs yesterday's PDH/PDL:

| Badge | Condition | Color | Trade bias hint |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GAP UP** | today_open > PDH (any gap) | Green | "longs at pullbacks" |
| **TEST PDH** | within 0.3% of PDH | Yellow | "break-or-fail" |
| **INSIDE HIGH** | between midpoint and PDH | Aqua | "range, upper half" |
| **INSIDE MID** | near range midpoint | Blue | "range, fade extremes" |
| **INSIDE LOW** | between PDL and midpoint | Aqua | "range, lower half" |
| **TEST PDL** | within 0.3% of PDL | Yellow | "bounce-or-break" |
| **GAP DOWN** | today_open < PDL | Red | "avoid longs, fade pops" |

Stage logic is still computed internally and lives in the alert payload as `stage` (triage agent uses it for scoring). Just no longer the chart-badge focus — the day-type is more directly actionable for instinct trading.

### PDH/PDL confluence

When today's open sits within **0.3% of PDH or PDL** (gap-up/gap-down days), the open-line alert IS the level alert — `open_reclaimed` and `staged_pdh_break` would normally fire on the same bar. The payload carries `near_pdh` / `near_pdl` flags; the webhook uses these to **suppress the twin** within a 5-min window:

| First arrives | Second (twin) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `open_reclaimed` (near_pdh=true) | `staged_pdh_break` | Twin suppressed. Message header: "Open + PDH confluence ↑" |
| `staged_pdh_break` | `open_reclaimed` (near_pdh=true) | Twin (open_reclaimed) suppressed. Message header: plain "PDH break" |
| `open_lost` (near_pdl=true) | `staged_pdl_break` | Twin suppressed. Message header: "Open + PDL confluence ↓" |
| `staged_pdl_break` | `open_lost` (near_pdl=true) | Twin (open_lost) suppressed. Message header: plain "PDL break" |

Audit log records `confluence_twin_suppressed` with the dropped alert_type for EOD Report visibility.

## Pine 3 — `levels-week-month`

**File**: `pine_scripts/active/levels_week_month.pine`
**Purpose**: Visual reference only — PWH / PWL / PMH / PML horizontal lines + optional weekly EMA 8 / 21.

**No alerts fire from this indicator.** Per 2026-05-06 unification: weekly/monthly level events are folded into the daily alert layer via `levels-day-vwap` (see staged events above with the D / W / M unification).

You can toggle this indicator off the chart without losing any alert signal.

---

## Pine 4 — `open-line` (visual only)

**File**: `pine_scripts/active/open_line.pine`
**Monitors**: Today's opening price (captured on the first bar of each session, held flat through the day)
**Alerts**: **None — visual layer only.** The open_lost / open_reclaimed alerts fire from `levels-day-vwap` (Pine 2 above).

This indicator exists so the open-line **visual** (the orange dashed line + LOST/RECL diamonds) can be toggled on/off independently of the PDH/PDL/VWAP layer. Alerts live in `levels-day-vwap` so we only burn one TV watchlist alert slot for everything in the levels family.

Why split: when reviewing PDH/PDL setups, sometimes you want the open line invisible for clarity, but the alerts should still fire. Splitting the visual from the alert source gives that toggle independence without doubling the TV watchlist-alert overhead.

## Backend gating — what happens between Pine and Telegram

Order of gates applied in the triage agent (`triage-agent/live.py`) after an alert hits the database:

1. **Symbol-session dedup** (in `api/app/routers/tv_webhook.py`, env flag `SYMBOL_SESSION_DEDUP=true` default) — only the **first** alert per `(user, symbol, direction, session_date)` fires; subsequent same-direction alerts for the same symbol that session are dropped regardless of `alert_type`. Opposite-direction alerts (BUY → SHORT) still pass — that's a regime change worth signaling. This is the primary noise reducer on chop days (e.g., ETH-USD bouncing off EMA5/EMA10/EMA21/EMA50/SMA50 fires ONE alert, not 5–11). All alert types follow this gate uniformly — `open_reclaimed` / `open_lost` included, so even regime-change open events get capped by the first-fire rule (Pine's one-shot semantics + this gate stack additively).
2. **TV-webhook identity dedup** — same `(user, symbol, direction, alert_type)` within 60 minutes is suppressed. Secondary belt-and-suspenders against same-alert-type re-fires (mostly redundant with symbol-session dedup, useful when SYMBOL_SESSION_DEDUP is off).
3. **Non-index NOTICE drop** — any NOTICE-direction alert where `symbol` ∉ {SPY, QQQ, AIQ, NDX} is dropped before triage. Audited as `NOTICE_NON_INDEX_DROPPED`.
4. **Global NOTICE mute** — if `MUTE_NOTICE_ALERTS=true` (now **default true** as of 2026-05-15), all NOTICEs dropped from Telegram delivery. Audited as `NOTICE_MUTED`. EOD Report still shows them. Set env to `false` to re-enable NOTICE delivery on indexes (e.g., when you want `open_lost` or VWAP NOTICEs back).
5. **ETH MA rolling cooldown** — if alert is an ETH MA bounce/rejection AND a prior fire of the same `(symbol, alert_type)` happened within the last 4 hours, drop. Audited as `MA_COOLDOWN_HIT`. (Strictly tighter than the 60-min webhook dedup for ETH.)
6. **Cost budget** — daily triage spend cap (default $1.50).
7. **Triage agent runs** — LLM evaluates sector confluence, index alignment, CVD, volume, cluster. Assigns verdict (HIGH / NORMAL / MUTE) + reason.
8. **Non-index SHORT gate** (in `analytics/intraday_rules.py`) — SHORT-direction alerts on non-SPY/QQQ/AIQ/NDX symbols are dropped at the rule evaluation stage. Crypto path unaffected.
9. **Post mode filter** — `TRIAGE_POST_MODE=all` (default) sends everything; `high_only` / `high_mute` restricts.
10. **Telegram delivery** — format_unified renders the message; HIGH-conviction alerts get an inline chart.

## Env vars — what controls each gate

All on the Railway `triage-agent` service:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SYMBOL_SESSION_DEDUP` | `true` | One alert per `(user, symbol, direction, session_date)`. Set `false` to allow multiple same-direction alerts per symbol per day (legacy behavior, only 60-min identity dedup applies). |
| `MUTE_NOTICE_ALERTS` | `true` | All NOTICE alerts muted from Telegram by default (still hit DB / EOD Report). Set to `false` if you want them back. |
| `MA_COOLDOWN_HOURS` | `4` | Rolling cooldown window for MA alerts on capped symbols |
| `MA_COOLDOWN_SYMBOLS` | `ETH-USD` | Comma-separated list of symbols subject to MA cooldown |
| `TRIAGE_POST_MODE` | `all` | `all` / `high_only` / `high_mute` |
| `TRIAGE_DAILY_USD_CAP` | `1.50` | Daily LLM spend ceiling |

In Pine inputs (per chart instance):

| Input | Default | Pine |
|---|---|---|
| `fire_vwap_alerts` | `false` | levels-day-vwap (set true on SPY 10m chart) |
| `fire_proximity_alerts` | `false` | ma-ema-daily — MA proximity NOTICE alerts. Default off (was true) — was the primary NOTICE noise source. Re-enable per chart if needed. |
| `show_open` / `show_markers` | `true` | open-line (visual toggles; alerts always fire when conditions met) |
| `show_lines` / `show_vwap` / etc. | `true` | levels-day-vwap visual toggles |

## What you'd see in Telegram on a typical day

- **9:30-16:00 ET (US RTH)**: BUY alerts on the equity watchlist as PDH breaks / MA bounces / open reclaims fire. SHORT alerts only on SPY/QQQ/AIQ/NDX. NOTICE alerts on SPY/QQQ/AIQ/NDX (VWAP + open_lost events).
- **24/7 (crypto)**: BUY alerts on BTC-USD freely; ETH-USD throttled to one fire per `(symbol, MA)` every 4 hours.
- **Premarket / afterhours**: Mostly quiet. Premarket brief at 08:30 ET, EOD recap at 16:05 ET (gated by `ENABLE_PREMARKET_BRIEF` env flag).

## Audit trail — what's NOT in Telegram but visible in the EOD Report

Every dropped/muted alert still hits the database AND is audited with a verdict tag. The EOD Report (`/eod-report` in the UI) shows all of them so you can review what would have fired:

- `NOTICE_NON_INDEX_DROPPED` — non-SPY/QQQ/AIQ/NDX NOTICE
- `NOTICE_MUTED` — NOTICE dropped by MUTE_NOTICE_ALERTS
- `MA_COOLDOWN_HIT` — ETH MA blocked by 4h cooldown
- TV-webhook 60-min dedup — logged but not stored as an alert row (suppressed at ingest)
- Backend-side filtered SHORTs (logged to triage logs, not as audit verdicts) — visible in EOD Report by direction filter

# Spec 14 — Swing Trade Entry/Exit System

## Problem Statement

**What:** The current alert system focuses on intraday entries (5-min bars, same-session exits). Swing traders who hold overnight need a separate system that operates on daily bars, enters at structural levels (RSI 30, 200MA, 50MA), and exits on daily closes — not intraday noise.

**Why:** Swing traders are a key user segment. They need different signals (daily timeframe), different entries (critical support levels), different exits (daily close-based, not intraday stops), and different Telegram formatting (labeled "SWING" to distinguish from day trades).

**What success looks like:**
- Swing alerts fire via Telegram labeled "SWING LONG" / "SWING EXIT"
- Entries only at high-conviction daily levels (RSI 30, 200MA, 50MA bounce)
- Exits based on daily closes (not intraday wicks)
- Completely isolated from intraday alert rules
- Trades tracked separately with swing-specific P&L

---

## Current State

### What Exists (strong foundation)
- `analytics/swing_rules.py` — 3 setup rules + 5 professional rules
- `alerting/swing_scanner.py` — EOD orchestrator, DB helpers, runs at 4:15 PM
- `swing_trades` table — tracks active/closed swing trades with RSI
- `fetch_prior_day()` — returns all daily MAs, EMAs, RSI14
- SPY regime gate — market filter
- API endpoints: `/swing/regime`, `/swing/categories`, `/swing/trades/active`
- Symbol categorization (buy_zone, strongest, building_base, etc.)

### What's Missing
- Swing alerts don't reach Telegram (no "SWING" label format)
- No RSI 30 bounce entry rule (only RSI zone crossover notice)
- No 50MA hold/bounce entry rule
- No daily-close-based exit system (current exits are intraday)
- No RSI target exits (e.g., bought at RSI 30 → exit at RSI 45-50)
- No close-below-PDL exit
- No close-below-key-MA invalidation exit
- MACD and divergence data not populated in `prior_day`

## Swing Entry Rules

### Rule 1: RSI 30 Bounce (Oversold Reversal)
```
Trigger: Daily RSI14 crosses above 30 (was below, now above)
Confirm: Close in upper 50% of daily range (buying pressure)
Entry:   Daily close
Stop:    Close below the low of the RSI < 30 day (daily close basis)
T1:      RSI reaches 45 (first momentum target)
T2:      RSI reaches 50-55 (mean reversion complete)
Score:   +20 if near 200MA, +10 if volume > avg, +10 if SPY bullish
```

### Rule 2: 200MA Hold/Bounce
```
Trigger: Daily low wicks to within 1% of 200MA AND closes above it
Confirm: Prior trend was above 200MA (pullback, not breakdown)
         At least 20 days above 200MA in last 30 days
Entry:   Daily close
Stop:    Daily close below 200MA (thesis invalidated)
T1:      50MA (first overhead MA)
T2:      20MA (trend resume target)
Score:   +20 if RSI < 40, +10 if hammer candle, +10 if SPY bullish
```

### Rule 3: 50MA Hold/Bounce
```
Trigger: Daily low wicks to within 0.5% of 50MA AND closes above it
Confirm: 50MA is rising (today > 10 days ago)
         Price was above 50MA prior (pullback to support)
Entry:   Daily close
Stop:    Daily close below 50MA
T1:      20MA or prior swing high
T2:      Prior day high or new highs
Score:   +20 if RSI 35-45, +10 if green candle, +10 if SPY bullish
```

### Rule 4: 20MA Pullback (Trend Continuation)
```
Trigger: Daily close within 0.5% of rising 20MA
Confirm: 20MA > 50MA (uptrend confirmed)
         RSI between 40-55 (not overbought)
Entry:   Daily close
Stop:    Daily close below 20MA
T1:      Prior swing high
T2:      1.5x risk above entry
Score:   +10 if green candle, +10 if volume increasing
```
*Already exists as `check_swing_pullback_20ema` — enhance with better stop/target*

### Rule 5: RSI Divergence (Advanced)
```
Trigger: Price makes lower low, RSI14 makes higher low
Confirm: At support level (near MA or prior swing low)
Entry:   Daily close
Stop:    Below the lower low (daily close basis)
T1:      RSI 45
T2:      RSI 55
Score:   +20 if at 200MA, +10 if volume spike on reversal bar
```
*Exists as `check_swing_rsi_divergence` — needs daily_closes/daily_rsi data*

## Swing Exit Rules (Daily Close Basis ONLY)

### Exit 1: RSI Target Reached
```
Condition: RSI14 reaches target zone
  - If entered from RSI < 30 → exit at RSI 45-50
  - If entered from MA bounce → exit at RSI 65-70
Action:  Send "SWING EXIT" notification with P&L
         Do NOT auto-close — user decides
```

### Exit 2: Close Below Prior Day Low
```
Condition: Daily close < prior day low
Action:  Send "SWING EXIT" notification
         "Daily close below PDL — swing thesis weakening"
```

### Exit 3: Close Below Key MA (Invalidation)
```
Condition: Daily close below the MA that was the entry thesis
  - Entered at 200MA → close below 200MA = invalidated
  - Entered at 50MA → close below 50MA = invalidated
  - Entered at 20MA → close below 20MA = invalidated
Action:  Send "SWING EXIT — INVALIDATED" notification
         Strongest exit signal — thesis is broken
```

### Exit 4: Close Below Stop Level
```
Condition: Daily close below the stop price set at entry
Action:  Send "SWING STOP REACHED" notification
         Same as current stop tracking but DAILY close, not intraday wick
```

## Multi-Timeframe Levels

### Weekly Levels (already available in `prior_day`)
- `prior_week_high` / `prior_week_low` — key weekly S/R
- Weekly MA20, MA50 (from weekly bars)
- Weekly RSI — oversold on weekly = massive conviction

### Swing Entry Rules Should Include Weekly Context
| Level | Entry Type | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Weekly support hold** | Weekly low tested 2+ times, daily close above | BTC $68,863 weekly level |
| **Weekly MA50 bounce** | Price at weekly 50MA, daily RSI < 40 | Multi-month trend support |
| **Prior week low reclaim** | Gap below PWL, daily close reclaims above | Weekly level reclaim |
| **Monthly support** | Price at prior month low, weekly RSI < 35 | Major structural floor |

### Rule 6: Weekly Support Bounce (NEW)
```
Trigger: Daily close within 1% of prior_week_low or weekly support zone
Confirm: Zone tested 2+ times on weekly chart
         Daily RSI < 45 (not overbought)
         Daily close in upper 50% of range (holding)
Entry:   Daily close
Stop:    Daily close below weekly support zone
T1:      Prior week high
T2:      Weekly MA20
Score:   +20 if weekly RSI < 35, +10 if monthly support nearby
```

### Rule 7: Monthly Level Bounce (NEW)
```
Trigger: Daily close within 1.5% of prior_month_low
Confirm: Monthly MA20 or MA50 nearby (confluence)
Entry:   Daily close
Stop:    Daily close below monthly low
T1:      Prior week high
T2:      Monthly MA20
```

### Two-Phase Approach
1. **Intraday NOTICE** (3-min poll): "SWING WATCH — BTC nearing weekly support $68,863"
   - Awareness only, no Took/Skip buttons
   - Fires once per level per session
2. **EOD ENTRY** (4:15 PM): "SWING LONG BTC $68,906 — weekly support hold confirmed"
   - Only if daily close confirms the hold
   - Took/Skip buttons for trade tracking

### Key Isolation from Day Trades
| Aspect | Day Trades | Swing Trades |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Timeframe** | 5-min bars | Daily + Weekly bars |
| **Entry trigger** | Intraday patterns | Daily close at key levels |
| **Stop basis** | Intraday price | Daily close only |
| **Exit timing** | During session | After market close (next day) |
| **Hold period** | Minutes to hours | Days to weeks |
| **Telegram label** | "LONG" / "SHORT" | "SWING LONG" / "SWING EXIT" |
| **Approach alert** | N/A | "SWING WATCH" notice during session |
| **Alert type prefix** | Various | `swing_*` |
| **Database** | `alerts` + `real_trades` | `swing_trades` |
| **Scanner** | 3-min poll (entries) | 3-min poll (watch) + EOD (confirm) |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] RSI 30 bounce fires when RSI crosses above 30 on daily close
- [ ] 200MA bounce fires when price wicks to 200MA and closes above
- [ ] 50MA bounce fires similarly
- [ ] All swing entries labeled "SWING LONG" in Telegram with Took/Skip
- [ ] Exit notifications fire on daily close (not intraday wick)
- [ ] RSI target exit fires when RSI reaches target zone
- [ ] MA invalidation exit fires when daily close breaks below entry MA
- [ ] Swing trades tracked separately from day trades
- [ ] No swing alert fires during market hours (EOD only)
- [ ] SPY regime gate respected (no swings when SPY < 20MA)

---

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- RSI 30 bounce: test with RSI series [28, 29, 31] → should fire
- RSI 30 bounce: test with RSI series [28, 29, 29] → should NOT fire
- 200MA bounce: test with close above 200MA, low within 1% → should fire
- 200MA bounce: test with close below 200MA → should NOT fire
- Exit RSI target: entered at RSI 30, current RSI 46 → exit notification
- Exit MA invalidation: entered at 200MA, close below 200MA → exit notification

### E2E Tests
- Run swing_scan_eod() with test data
- Verify Telegram messages have "SWING" prefix
- Verify swing_trades DB rows created correctly
- Verify exit checks only use daily close (not intraday low)
